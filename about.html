    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

    <p>Always in progress…</p>

    <p>I am based in Naarm (Melbourne), Australia. Operating under Cynetic studios, I, (Hannah) create through collaborating with events and artists to design for social impact, building conceptual ideas and spaces through bespoke solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Services Offered:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Interactive media installations</li>
  <li>Projections</li>
  <li>New media art</li>
  <li>Event curation</li>
  <li>Graphic Design</li>
  <li>Brand and brand element creation</li>
  <li>Production / Art Department</li>
</ul>



    <p>Under the alias Cy_ I create soundscapes and perform my electronic music through DJing and live electronic music.</p>

    <p>Under Hannah Ogawa, I am a trained actor, having appeared in Australian TV. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11223403/" target="_blank">IMDB</a></p>

    <p>My values include breaking down boundaries and barriers - creating thought-provoking work that encourages people to view themselves and others in the same context, building humanity and empathy between people. I like to do this through creating synesthesia, reminding people of a collective consciousness they share with others through senses. I return care to the community, always open to collaborating and creating spaces and media that is for the community and enables people to feel seen, included and heard in an exciting way. I use design as a tool for social change and impact, utilising visual culture as a medium for furthering my, and my client’s motives. I enjoy experimenting and pushing limits, working with mixed media and creating with a powerful idea. I value curiosity and learning, constantly wanting to push myself and others to create something impactful for the local community.</p>

    <p>I am innovative, insightful and dynamic. I am curious about the growing intersection of art and technology and human computer interaction. I am inspired by cyber feminism, and collective consciousness. I am excited by underground cultures and opposing the big daddy mainframe.</p>
